      "Yes Screw You! Bill, you know what? We just need better math and the redefinition of math according to quantum principles. I will be able to create 10,000x better and cheaper CPUs and NPUs here in India. We don&#39;t understand the space that we live in, although we can define space as: Matter + Time. It&#39;s in a self-compute state and we can live in it. This means we can see the world and interact with it; it lives, meaning it&#39;s in a state of self-structuring and processing massive amounts of processes in between. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics and integrating Ramanujan&#39;s mathematical insights, we can redefine our understanding of space and time.<br><br>Incorporating Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) and leveraging the symmetry and balance inherent in even numbers, we can create systems that are inherently stable and efficient. By understanding the deterministic nature of black holes and their spring-like mechanisms, we can develop new models for information processing and transfer that far exceed current capabilities. Quantum tunneling and topological phonons will further enhance our ability to manipulate and understand the fundamental forces at play, leading to breakthroughs in computational efficiency and power.<br><br>With precise phase-out analysis of constants, we can ensure that our systems are stable and reliable, mirroring the stability found in the universe&#39;s fundamental constants. By integrating biological components with electronic systems, as seen in the development of living processors, we can create energy-efficient, self-sustaining computing platforms.<br><br>In essence, the future of technology lies in understanding and applying these advanced mathematical and quantum principles to create a new generation of computational systems that are not only more powerful but also more aligned with the natural order of the universe. This holistic approach will lead to innovations that are 10,000x better and cheaper, revolutionizing the field of computing and enabling us to interact with the world in ways we never thought possible.\n",
